# Pixel Palz
**Overview -** Pixel Palz is a online web communication service which allows users to make friends with strangers that have similar interests online. RPG elements will be incorporated into the website to motivate usability and in-chat games will help users to connect with each other faster. This project will be helpful for users that want simplicity when it comes to making friends by eliminating the need to find and join servers/groupchats.

**Similar Projects -** Similar projects include Omegle, Discord, and other chatting services. Our project will distinguish itself from these existing services by "gamifying" and simplifying them, which provides a much better and direct environment for people who just want to make friends on the spot.

**Motivation -** No friends, want to make friends

**Target Audience -** Our target audience will be people who are looking to make friends but not sure where to start. They don't want to put in the research when it comes to which servers/groupchats to join and just want a quick and direct way to meet people.
