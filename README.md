# Pixel Palz
**Overview -** Pixel Palz is a online web communication service which allows users to make friends with strangers that have similar interests online. RPG elements will be incorporated into the website to motivate usability and in-chat games will help users to connect with each other faster. This project will be helpful for users that want simplicity when it comes to making friends by eliminating the need to find and join servers/groupchats.

**Similar Projects -** Similar projects include Omegle, Discord, and other chatting services. Our project will distinguish itself from these existing services by "gamifying" and simplifying them, which provides a much better and direct environment for people who just want to make friends on the spot.

**Motivation -** In a study conducted by Ballard Brief, “generation Z is the loneliest generation that the world has seen, with isolation rates higher than both millennials and members of Generation X.” It is also noted that individuals who are socially isolated suffer from many health problems such as depression and insomnia. 

According to a Forbes article, “73% of Gen-Z report feeling alone sometimes or always. Loneliness can be as damaging to health as smoking 15 cigarettes per day. And people who experience social isolation have a 32% higher risk of early death.”

As people of Gen Z who’ve experienced or seen friends that experienced this first-hand, it is our goal to create a platform with a comfortable environment for people to connect with each other (whether they choose to be anonymous or not) through similar interests, situations, and forms of entertainment. We hope for our users to occupy their time connecting with each other, rather than resorting to harmful substances in response to numbing away their loneliness or life problems.


**Target Audience -** Our target audience will be people who are looking to make friends but not quite sure where to start. They don't want to put in the research when it comes to which servers or group chats to join and just want a quick and direct way to meet people. We understand that talking for hours on end may seem boring to some people, which is why we added gaming components to allow users to take “breaks” in between conversations, which allow them to find even more things to talk about.

We also accommodate those who wish for a fully anonymous environment - a place where there is no prejudice due to appearance, gender, race, or another defining factors that lead to discrimination. Our user’s privacy is one of, if not, the most prioritized aspect of our project vision.
